# MoneyTalks

A simple common interface for payment service providers. Don't let a specific vendor hold
you hostage. Payment gateway integration should not be
painful. MoneyTalks provides a clean and simple interface which lets you seamlessly attach vendor-specific code 
for easy integration.

## Supported PSPs

If your provider is still not supported feel free to contribute. In the future psp specific implementation
will be bundled as a separate gem. See this link to understand how to create a provider specific gem

1. Adyen

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'money_talks'

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install money_talks

## Rails

If you are using rails, first create the money_talks.rb file inside your initializers folder

## Environments

MoneyTalks will smoothly detect your ENV variables in order to set its own environment. 
In order it first checks RAILS_ENV, RACK_ENV and if none is set it will automatically set
the default environment to development


```ruby

MoneyTalks.configure :adyen do |config|
  config.user = "my_user"
  config.pass = "my_password"
  config.use_local_wsdl = true
end

```

## Support for Brazil

Adyen's current published live url doest not support installments! You can use the option
config.use_local_wsdl to use the correct WSDL


Building a payment is easy:

``` ruby

class Payment < ActiveRecord::Base


def authorize
  p = MoneyTalks.build_payment :credit_card do |payment|
    payment.merchant_account  = "QuerobolsaCOM"
    payment.reference = MoneyTalks::Helpers::TransactionNumberGenerator.generate(size:8)
    payment.shopper_email = "joaodasilva@fake.com"
    payment.shopper_IP = "189.102.29.193"
    payment.shopper_reference = "JoÃ£o da Silva"
    
    payment.amount do |a|
      a.currency = "BRL"
      a.value = 430098
    end
    
    payment.installments do |i|
      i.value = 2
    end
    
    payment.card do |card|
      card.expiry_month = "06"
      card.expiry_year = "2016"
      card.holder_name = "John Doe"
      card.number = "5555444433331111"
      card.cvc = "737"
    end
  end

end


```

After building a payment you gain access to your provider operations
